Introduction
------------

The ‘Go’ travel app is a simple logbook app, it provides the
following features:

* **Multi-account support** – You can register multiple accounts on one device and protect
your trips using a password; additionally, your password is never stored on your device in
plain text for extra security (lol).

* **Account updates** – You can change your account details (email, username & password)
under the ‘Account’ tab.

* **Add trips** – You can add trips under the ‘Add Trip’ tab; additionally, you can include a
variety of details for a trip, such as: name, address, category, cost, Wi-Fi password, website,
email & phone number.

* **View trips** – You can view all your trips under the ‘Trips’ tab and filter through them by
category; additionally, you can view even more details by tapping on a trip.

* **Edit/remove trips** – You can edit the details of an existing trip or remove it entirely by
tapping on a trip under the ‘Trips’ tab.
